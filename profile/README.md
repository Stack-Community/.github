### ‚úç What We Do

1. **Development Project**<br>
   Check out our [interpreter](https://github.com/stack-community/stack-lang) of the Stack programming language.<br>
   That's the main and biggest project. We design and develop new function and release it.
   
3. **Establishing Standards**<br>
   We are working on establishing [standards](https://github.com/stack-community/standards) to ensure consistency different dialects.<br>
